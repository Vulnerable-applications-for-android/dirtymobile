# Dirtymobile
Dirty Mobile is a vulnerable Android application. It's based on over 20 vulnerable functions including insecure IPC mechanisms, Activities, Webviews and others.
It's made for learning and practicing Android security tests.

# Usage 
1. Get yourself a copy of OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard
2. Install the dirtymobile.apk file
3. Fire one of the functions available
4. Try to reverse the apk file to find out what's going on underneath (Use source files only as a last resort).
5. Find insecure mechanism in vulnerable function and try to exploit it. You can also find flags (not always).
6. Have fun.

# Note
Some Webview functions require you to setup a local website and configure hosts file to point evilsite.local to your website.
